# Vim Style Police

This plugin aims to provide a common interface to all code style check tools.

It has been currently tested to work well with [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) and [haml-lint](https://github.com/causes/haml-lint). Feel free to raise a ticket to support any new tools.
